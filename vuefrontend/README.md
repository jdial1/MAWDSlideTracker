## Project setup

```
npm install

## NOTE - After running NPM install, vue project would not compile due to issues with bootstrap-vue. You may need to run this seperately:

```
npm i vue bootstrap-vue bootstrap


```

## Another build error was resolved by running the following:

```
npm i vue-template-compiler --save-dev
```

npm run build
